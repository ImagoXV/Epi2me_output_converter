# Epi2me_output_converter
This piece of code might as well be a piece of shit, but it's working. 
Make sure you use it in a new empty directory. 
Just add your EPI2ME 16S barcoding output csv in the directory. 

Run the code

There you go

Problems noted : Unclassified taxa are merged into one global unclassified one.
That's really a shame, but EPI2ME does not give associated OTU ID or anything allowing us to climb back to clustering informations.
